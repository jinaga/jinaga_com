title: "Retrieving Information"
---

Once you've written a specification function, you can retrieve facts matching that specification.
When you need those facts in a single snapshot, you will run a query.
But when you need to be continuously informed about those facts, then you will start a watch.

## Query

The function `j.query` returns facts matching a specification as an array.
The first parameter is a starting fact.
The second is a *preposition*, which you create by calling `j.for` with a specification function.

```typescript
const posts = await j.query(person, j.for(postsByAuthor));
```

[Try it](/examples/query/successors)

You can extend a preposition using `.then`.
This takes another specification function which continues where the previous one left off.

```typescript
const tags = await j.query(person, j
    .for(postsByAuthor)
    .then(tagsForPost));
```

[Try it](/examples/query/successors-of-successors)

## Watch

While `j.query` is done as soon as it returns the results, you might want to keep watching the results, for example to update a user interface.
Call `j.watch` and pass in two functions: the first is called when a fact is added, and the second when a fact is removed.

```typescript
const postWatch = j.watch(person,
    j.for(publishedPostsByAuthor),
    addPostToList,
    removePostFromList);

function addPostToList(post) {
    ...
    return postListItem;
}

function removePostFromList(postListItem) {
    ...
}
```

[Try it](/examples/watch/add-and-remove)

You can chain watches together to continue loading details within a list.

```typescript
const titleWatch = postWatch.watch(
    j.for(titlesForPost),
    setPostTitle);

function setPostTitle(postListItem, postTitle) {
    postListItem.text(postTitle.value);
}
```

When you are done, be sure to call `stop` on the top level.

```typescript
postWatch.stop();
```

This stops the entire tree of watches so that no further updates are attempted.

If you are using a front-end framework such as React, you will probably use an adapter like [Jinaga React](/documents/jinaga-react/) rather than creating watches directly.

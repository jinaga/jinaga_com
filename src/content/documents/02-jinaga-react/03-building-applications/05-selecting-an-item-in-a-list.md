title: Selecting an Item in a List

When you display a list of objects to the user, they are naturally going to want to interact with them.
Selecting one will often be the first step to a subsequent action.
They may ultimately want to edit the object, drill down to related objects, or delete it altogether.
While these are sometimes shown as action buttons per line in a Web app, selection provides a natural two-step process that keeps the UI nice and clean.

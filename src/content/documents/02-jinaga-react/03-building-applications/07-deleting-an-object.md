title: Deleting an Object
---

Removing an item from a list is a dangerous operation.
We want to make sure that the user knows what they are doing.
Jinaga keeps a complete history of objects, even the deleted ones, but the user doesn't know that.
There are three available patterns for deletion that help ensure that the user can still get to their data.

- Prompt before delete
- Confirm intent before delete
- Restore from recycle bin
- Time Travel!

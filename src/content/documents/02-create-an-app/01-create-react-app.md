title: "Create React App"
---

The easiest way to start is with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

```bash
npx create-react-app my-application --template typescript
```

This will create a folder called `my-application` in the current directory.
That folder will contain a brand new React application.
Change to that application and run the app with `npm start`.

Here we used the TypeScript template.
If you prefer plain JavaScript, run the command without the `--template typescript` option.

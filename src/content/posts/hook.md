A Jinaga mobile or web app works with local data first.
The app or PWA works offline.
When the device comes online, the data synchronizes with the server.

But that's just the start.
The developer experience is incredible.

Imagine coding a mobile app as if the data were already on the device.
Or writing a web app that loads data from the local store, not the server.
Imagine not maintaining a REST API.

How much faster could you build your app?

Write code only on the edge using Jinaga.
Deploy a network of Jinaga Replicators to move data between devices and back-end services.

You will never have to write a REST API for your app.
You won't need to maintain a database schema.
And you won't need to set up queues or topics to get data to your services.
